# Ad-Hoc Network (Windows to pi)
To create an ad-hoc netowrk between your computer and the pi you will need to go to your Windows settings and type `mobile hotspot`.
Turn on your hotspot and change the ssid to `MMT`, the password to `raspberry` and the raspberry pi in the robotics room should try to connect
to your network. You may disconnect from the internet on your computer but you will not be able to push to GitHub. You will still be able to
communicate with the raspberry pi though.

> Note: The Windows hotspot is a bit strange in that you can't start a hotspot without an internet connection but you can disconnect afterwards.
if you are out in the field, try using your hotspot ona phone to connect to your laptop and startup your hotspot. You can then disconnect from the
phone hotpot and you will still have the peer to peer conection with the raspberry pi
